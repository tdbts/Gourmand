            <p><span className="company-name">Gourmand</span> is for people who absolutely love food.  Those who always search for new restaurants, dishes, and neighborhoods to try.</p>
            <p>The problem is that whittling down reviews to find good places is difficult and time consuming.  Information about restaurants is fractured into many different platforms.  Who has time to conduct a research project whenever they get a little hungry?</p>
            <p>At <span className="company-name">Gourmand</span>, we believe the food should speak for itself.  The rest will follow.</p>
            <p>Salud!</p>
