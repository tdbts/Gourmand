Now I&#39;m accustomed to paying $8 for a classic, so this steal hit my wallet considerately (though I wouldn&#39;t say it was bursting with meat).

The meat slices are semi-thick cut (at least thicker than the ones I&#39;ve had in Chinatown), and pickled carrots aren&#39;t as tart (yay!).\n\n<b>Grilled Pork</b> Banh Mi #8: not your classic <b>grilled pork</b> because these are more chunky pieces than a slab of thinly <b>grilled pork</b> chop at other places.

I ordered the bánh mì thit nuong which is a <b>grilled pork</b> sandwich.  I think they recently increased their prices as the sandwich was $5.50 instead of the $5 on some of the menu photos but still worth it for $5.50.  The baguette was perfectly toasted: crispy enough to know it was toasted but easy on your teeth when you bite in.  The vegetables looked and tasted fresh and the pork was seasoned and cooked well.  The only reservation I had was that they put peanuts in my sandwich (is that a thing with bánh mì?).  The peanuts took away the juiciness of the rest of the sandwich.  Despite this, the sandwich was still one of the best bánh mìs I&#39;ve had and I know I&#39;ll be coming back to Ba Xuyen soon!",

I ordered 2 sammiches to go, one #1 combo spicy for the bro, and one #8 <b>grilled pork</b> for me to scarf down in my bfs car. It took like less than ten mins to prepare my order and it came out to 11 bucks. \n\nMy #8 was absolutely scrumptious. The baguette was perfectly toasted and crunchy on the outside yet soft in the inside, not stale at all. The ratio of fillings to bread was good, not too bready. The bbq pork was seasoned well (not too sweet like other places I&#39;ve had) and cooked tender. The pickled veggies were crispy and quite refreshing for a 90 degree day. What set Ba Xuyen&#39;s bahn mi different from other ones I&#39;ve had was that there was little bits of peanuts or peanut sauce in it which complemented the sandwich perfectly. Later that night I snuck a piece of my bros #1, which held up great and wasn&#39;t soggy at all. Delicious. The pork roll, the head cheese (usually I&#39;m not a fan), roast pork and whatever other goodness was perfect although the bread was obviously not crispy anymore. \n\nI can&#39;t believe after being relatively close to this area for almost 7 yrs I&#39;m just finding out about this!

        "text": "My buddy and I ordered the most traditional (Menu #1) sandwich with the ham, head cheese, Pork roll, Pork teriyaki, and BBQ with pâté and butter, as well as the (Menu #8) <b>Grilled Pork</b> with pâté and butter sandwich. Both were quite tasty. Each was $5. The Vietnamese coffee was also quite tasty. \n\nA word to the wise: if you ask for it to be moderately spiced, they will accommodate, but when you get a mouthful of that hot pepper which is more intermittently spaced when you ask for it to be less spicy, you will want to have a drink handy. Those were HOT peppers.",

        "text": "Head cheese / pate usually scares me. After some prolonged exposure therapy here, I am happy to say it does not any longer. A Vietnamese friend recommended to pop in here; the sandwiches did not disappoint. Even better, they are cheap! You can walk out with like 10 different things without a huge dent in your wallet. Service is pleasant and fast. Bread is crunchy and fresh.\n\nGo for the #1 for sure &#34;Pate Thit Nuong&#34; above all others. It has a perfect balance of flavor- sweet, salty, zesty, tangy...pretty much everything. It is loaded with ham and they don&#39;t skimp on the cilanto and pickled veg. There&#39;s a perfect amount of each. Second favorite was the BBQ pork then the <b>grilled pork</b>. While I enjoyed them all, I split the sandwiches with friends and we were all fighting over the remaining pieces of the #1. Vietnamese iced coffee was refreshing and hit the spot. \n\nPass on:\nThai ice tea was eh, though I&#39;m a little biased. It wasn&#39;t Thai-sweet like the real deal in Thailand. So maybe still check it out if you aren&#39;t looking for a nice 100g sugar treat.\nNoodle was just decent too...stick with the delicious sandwiches!",

        "text": "This place has been around for a REALLY REALLY LONG TIME! Literally when I first immigrated to America from Vietnam, I really miss eating Vietnamese street food like banh mi, so my aunt would literally drive over the bridge from Staten Island to buy me and my siblings banh mi from ba Xuyen. It really made us miss home a little less. I was 10 years old back then, I am now 24, and my family has been loyal to this place for forever! It&#39;s the only place we would ever get our banh mi from now. I have just moved to Brooklyn a day ago, living around 30 minutes away from Ba Xuyen by bus; I was still determined to make this place my first Brooklyn meal. \n\nAll the sandwiches are priced at $5 for one, CASH ONLY Y&#39;all! This is a really reasonable price for a good hearty sandwich. Trust me, it&#39;s a bang for your buck. Today I got a &#34;banh mi thit nuong&#34; which is a <b>grilled pork</b> banh mi. The pork is nicely marinated and goes so well with that flaky toasted baguette! They also throw in roasted peanuts as well as some fried shallots on the pork for extra flavors. Of course there&#39;s your traditional veggies toppings as well: pickled carrots and daikon, cucumbers, peppers, and cilantro. It was seriously love at first bite! I&#39;m already dreaming about my next banh mi LOL",
